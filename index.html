                     <p>I remember wanting to be a graphic designer when I was in my junior year of highschool back in 2006.  
                        I really enjoyed learning Photoshop and creating digital art and manipulating photos.  By the time I 
                        got towards the end of my senior year in 2008 I had decided I'd take a break from school and work for 
                        a year or two to save money.  It was durring this time that I got one of my first warehouse jobs and
                        really started to fall in love with playing the guitar and writing music. Music has always been a love
                        of mine but I never really tried to start a band and write songs with a group until this point.  Working
                        warehouse jobs gave me enough of a steady income to be able to live comfortably but also chase a new dream 
                        wich was trying to make it playing music with some of my best friends.  In this realm of the DIY music scene
                        that I found myself in I was also able to start utilizing my other love for graphic design by creating
                        designs for our merch and flyers for shows.  Once things really started to take off it became appearent that
                        the warehouse jobs I had been working were no longer flexible enough to allow for the time I would need to 
                        be on the road, writing, and desinging, so I looked into the service industry and found what I needed as a 
                        server in the resturant industry.

                  <p>Around 2018 was when I took my first steps into the service industry and started working with Mission Taco Joint.  
                     I always get nervous when I start something new, because you're taking a step into the unknown theres always that
                      voice in the back of my mind telling me that I may fail.  Those moments are hard to overcome but I've learned that
                     any progression in life is going to require taking steps into the unkown, you just have to let your dream of achieving 
                     something overpower that feeling of fear.  Once I took that step into the resturant industry things really started to take
                     off.  I had a super flexible schedule, was making really good money working in downtown KCMO, my band was playing
                     shows almost every week, we booked studio time to record another album, and we had set up our first really big 
                     tour that would lead us to play South By So What in Texas. Everything seemed to by going great, but as we started 
                     to get into 2019 we started to hear whispers of something going around called "Covid".  Once covid started to 
                     escalate, our tour that we had worked so hard to set up started to have dates cancelled one by one untill we
                     had none left.  Shortly after that my job called to inform me that the resturant would have to close down until 
                     the covid outbreak calmed down.  Our resturant was forced to be shut down for a little over 3 months.  During 
                     that time I was forced to collect unemployment and stay inside like most of the world.  I tried to make the most of
                     my time by keeping my mind busy writing and recording music.  Its during this time that I really start to get to 
                     known the recording DAWs Im working with and I really start to love the layout and interactions I get when using these 
                     many different styles of software.  I started to get really curious about how these things work and what makes a program 
                     do all thes magnificent things.  Once the pandemic finally starts to simmer down we're able to finally get back to work.
                     The first year back was really a struggle with trying to navigate all the regulations the city had put on public spaces 
                     while also trying to keep all of our guests happy.  During the shut down due to the pandemic many of the great DIY venues
                     in the city did not survive so once the band was at a point of things getting back to normal we found ourselves with no where to 
                     play anymore.  We all also came out of the pandemic as different people and though we all loved music and playing it 
                     we realized we wanted to have a little more job security, so we all parted ways and went down different paths to progress
                     in something else.  I ended up staying with my job, and have been there for 6 years now, and in my 5th year with the company was promoted to manager.
                     After spending so much time playing with music software, I had developed a desire to want to learn what makes these programs tick.
                     So I started researching how I could embark on a journey of learning how to write a program.   I purchased a frew books on learning
                     HTML and CSS, and another on Javascript. Practicing with these books really helped me get some of the fundementals started but I 
                     kept running into a wall on certain things and needed a little more help.  A few of my fellow employees mentioned 
                     websites like Codecademy and Free Code Camp, so I did some courses on there and while these helped a lot I was still hitting
                     a wall and knew that if I just had some sort of instructor to guide me to the right path when I get stuck I could really 
                     excel.  Thats when my girlfriend had mentioned that one of her clients are a couple that are computer programmers and they
                     recommended trying to take a course through Launch Code.  Truly if I had the money I would go to college for computer science
                     but unfortunately the price is out of reach for me and going to college while working full time would be almost impossible.
                     So when I saw that Launch Code was a completely free course as long as you got accepted I became very excited and eager to 
                     apply.  Once I was accepted I was excited to start this course and push myself to aquire the knowledge that they are so 
                     generous to offer. As I currently write this I am now almost 2 months into the course and working on my 4th graded assignment,
                     building a webpage. So far I have learned so many great things in this course and the knowledge that my instructors have 
                     shared has helped me to become an even better programmer.  There have been times where I've wanted to give up because I just
                     couldn't get a program to work as intended, but I pushed through and just kept trying different things and reaching out to 
                     my instructors for guidence and have kept progressing as a result.  I know it wont be easy but I can't help but get excited
                     about what the future holds for me as a computer programmer.

               </figure>
                  <p>When thinking about where this path could lead me I am filled with optimism.  I would love to get a job with a tech company
                     and make a decent wage writing code.  I would also love to be able to use my skills for freelance work helping smaller local
                     business build websites and write programs.  My girlfriend has her own dog training company and I'd love to be able to build her 
                     a website that is as astonishing as she is.  I would like to get to a point where I can live comfortably while doing something 
                     I love, and also being able to help others who share the same dream as me.
